    Why would anyone even want to hack an answering machine
and for what purpose? There are many reasons and things you
can do once you have control of someone elses machine. If for
some reason you need to spy on a business or person you can
hack their machine and take control using the information for
your own personal use. There is also the old "change the
message" secret to make it say something to the effect of
this line accepts all toll charges so you can bill third
party calls to that number. You can also use an answering
machine for your own personal use, as in making it your own
voice mail type system for people to call. Only do this if
you know someone is out of town. If they come home from
shopping and find their machine changed it might cause
problems. With these basic ideas in mind you can see hacking
an answering machine could be very useful to certain
individuals.

    How can a person hack an answering machine? Well most
answering machines built now have remote access features
which allow the owner, or anyone to call in and press a
security code to play their messages. This is where the fun
begins.  Some older models don't have remote access so you
cannot do anything to them. Also if you know someone has a
machine but you call and it doesn't answer, let the phone
ring about 15 times. This will tell the machine to turn
itself on, so you can hack it. The actual number varies
between machines.
